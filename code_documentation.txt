## SYSTEM WORKFLOW

### Incoming Call Flow

1. User calls the Twilio phone number
2. Twilio forwards the call to the Flask app at the /answer endpoint
3. The app generates TwiML that:
   - Greets the caller
   - Captures their speech
   - Sends speech to /process_speech endpoint
4. The /process_speech endpoint:
   - Receives the speech text from Twilio
   - Sends it to OpenAI for processing
   - Gets an AI-generated response
   - Converts the response to speech using TwiML
   - Sends it back to the caller
5. The conversation continues in a loop until the caller hangs up or doesn't respond

### Outgoing Call Flow

1. The application initiates a call using the make_call() function:
   - Creates a call through Twilio API
   - Specifies the /outgoing_call endpoint for instructions
   - Sets up status callbacks
2. When the recipient answers, Twilio requests instructions from /outgoing_call endpoint
3. The app generates TwiML that:
   - Plays a greeting or custom message
   - Captures recipient's speech
   - Sends speech to /process_speech endpoint
4. The /process_speech endpoint:
   - Receives the speech text from Twilio
   - Sends it to OpenAI for processing
   - Gets an AI-generated response
   - Converts the response to speech using TwiML
   - Sends it back to the recipient
5. The conversation continues in a loop until completed

### Call Status Tracking

1. Twilio posts status updates to the /call_status endpoint
2. The app logs these updates to call_status_log.csv including:
   - Timestamp
   - Call SID
   - Call status
   - Phone number

## COMMON USAGE EXAMPLES

### Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Flask application
python app.py

# In a separate terminal, expose your local server with ngrok
ngrok http 5001
```

### Making a Single Call

```python
from outgoing_calls import make_call

# Make a call with a custom message
make_call("+1XXXXXXXXXX", "Hello, this is a test message from the AI assistant.")
```

### Making Batch Calls

```python
from outgoing_calls import batch_call

# Call multiple numbers from a CSV file with a 60-second delay between calls
batch_call("phone_numbers.csv", 60)
```

### Scheduling a Call

```python
from outgoing_calls import schedule_call
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Schedule a call 10 minutes from now
schedule_time = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=10)
schedule_call("+1XXXXXXXXXX", schedule_time, "This is a scheduled call.")
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Twilio Issues

- **Call not initiating**: Check your Twilio account balance and credentials
- **"Number unverified" error**: Verify the number in your Twilio console (required for trial accounts)
- **No audio**: Ensure TwiML is valid and Twilio can reach your webhook URL

### OpenAI Issues

- **API errors**: Verify your API key and account status
- **Rate limits**: If hitting rate limits, add delays or upgrade your plan
- **Slow responses**: Try using a smaller max_tokens value for faster responses

### Webhook Issues

- **Webhook not reachable**: Ensure ngrok is running and URL is correct in .env
- **ngrok URL changed**: Update WEBHOOK_URL in .env when restarting ngrok
- **404 errors**: Check route paths in app.py match Twilio webhook configurations

## CUSTOMIZATION

### Changing AI Behavior

Modify the system prompt in get_ai_response() function in app.py:

```python
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful phone assistant. Your name is [NAME]. Answer all questions in a [STYLE] manner."},
    {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
]
```

### Adding New Routes

To add a new interaction type, create a new route in app.py:

```python
@app.route("/new_feature", methods=['POST'])
def new_feature():
    # Create TwiML response
    resp = VoiceResponse()
    
    # Add custom logic
    
    return str(resp)
```

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
